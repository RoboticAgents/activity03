## Suggested Experiments

### Temperature Sensor (TMP36)
1. Room temperature vs. holding the sensor (body heat)
2. Ice water vs. warm water temperature readings
3. Measure temperature at different locations in the room
4. Calculate temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit

### Soil Moisture Sensor
1. Completely dry vs. completely wet readings
2. Test different moisture levels (dry, slightly damp, wet, submerged)
3. Compare different materials (soil, sand, water, air)
4. Determine threshold values for "needs watering" alerts

### Photoresistor Light Sensor
1. Bright light (flashlight) vs. darkness (cover sensor)
2. Natural light vs. artificial light readings
3. Different distances from light source
4. Determine threshold values for "too dark" or "bright enough"

## Multi-Sensor Challenge (Optional)

Combine all three sensors to create a "plant health monitor" that:
- Displays temperature
- Displays soil moisture level
- Displays light level
- Uses LED or buzzer to alert when conditions are unhealthy

**Code:**
```cpp
// Your multi-sensor code here (if you completed the challenge)
```

**Results:**
- [What did you accomplish?]
